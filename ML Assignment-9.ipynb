    "Cosine similarity is a good metric for text categorization because it measures the similarity between two vectors in a high-dimensional space, independent of their magnitudes. It considers the angle between the vectors, rather than their absolute values. It is commonly used when comparing text documents, as it captures the semantic similarity between them.\n",

    "Difficulties in using machine learning techniques on high-dimensional datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "Curse of Dimensionality: As the number of dimensions increases, the available data becomes sparse, leading to overfitting and poor generalization.\n",
    "Increased Computational Complexity: Computing distances, similarity measures, or optimization algorithms becomes computationally expensive with a high number of dimensions.\n",
    "Difficulty in Interpretation: Understanding the relationships and patterns in high-dimensional space becomes challenging due to the lack of visualization and high complexity.\n",
    "Techniques to handle high-dimensional datasets:\n",

    "Domain Knowledge: Leveraging domain knowledge to identify meaningful features and reduce irrelevant dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Make a few quick notes on:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. PCA is an acronym for Principal Component Analysis. It is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional space while retaining the most important information. It identifies orthogonal directions (principal components) that capture the maximum variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Vectors are mathematical objects that represent quantities with both magnitude and direction. In machine learning, vectors are often used to represent features or observations in a dataset. They can be represented as arrays or matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Embedded techniques refer to feature selection methods that are built into the learning algorithm itself. They automatically select relevant features during the model training process, eliminating the need for a separate feature selection step.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Make a comparison between:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Sequential backward exclusion vs. sequential forward selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential backward exclusion starts with all features and removes one feature at a time based on a defined criterion (e.g., drop in performance) until a desired subset of features is reached. It is a backward elimination process.\n",
    "Sequential forward selection starts with an empty set of features and adds one feature at a time based on a defined criterion (e.g., improvement in performance) until a desired subset of features is reached. It is a forward selection process.\n",
    "Both methods are iterative and aim to find an optimal subset of features, but they differ in their starting point and direction of feature selection.\n",
    "ii. Filter vs. wrapper function selection methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter methods evaluate features independently of any specific machine learning algorithm. They use statistical measures (e.g., correlation, mutual information) to rank features and select the top-ranked ones based on their relevance to the target variable.\n",
    "Wrapper methods evaluate features by using a specific machine learning algorithm as a black box. They assess feature subsets by training and evaluating the performance of the machine learning model using different combinations of features. The selected subset is based on the performance of the model.\n",
    "Filter methods are computationally efficient but may not consider feature interactions. Wrapper methods are computationally expensive but can capture feature interactions and dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. SMC (Similarity Matching Coefficient) vs. Jaccard coefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "SMC is a similarity metric that measures the number of positions with matching bits divided by the total number of positions. It is often used for binary features.\n",
    "Jaccard coefficient is a similarity metric that measures the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of two sets. It is commonly used for measuring the similarity between sets.\n",
    "SMC focuses on the similarity of individual positions, whereas the Jaccard coefficient considers the overall set similarity. SMC is suitable for binary features, while the Jaccard coefficient is more general and can be used for any type of set-based similarity measurement.  "
